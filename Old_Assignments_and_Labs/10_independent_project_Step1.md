# Assignment 10
## Independent Project, Step 1: 
### Define your challenge and describe it to all of us


For the independent project, the eventual goal will be for you to define and solve your own data challenge.  This first assignment will ask you to define the challenge (but not solve it yet).

1. Find a published paper with a published data set that interests you.  I suggest searching for things that interest you in the archives of [The Dryad Data Repository][dryad].  OR, if you have your own data set that you really want to work on, you are welcome to use that instead.  However, the analysis you do of those data must be novel for you; you may *not* simply repeat something you've done before.
2. Read the original publication and explore the data archive. 
3. Read the meta-data.  
4. Write a summary in your own words of  
	a. the goals of the study,  
	b. the methodology that produced the data  
	c. the type of data that are available to you:  
		1. format?  
		2. size?  
		3. any inconsistencies in the data files?  anything that looks problematic?
5. **Now for the meat of the project**: Define and describe an analysis that YOU want to do with the data.  This could be (i) repeating an analysis from the paper (as long as the authors did NOT give code that you are simply re-running ;-) ), (ii) doing something new that the authors didn't do, or (iii) a combination of the two.  The challenge you define for yourself should indeed be something you expect to be *challenging*.  For example: "Import the data and calculate the mean of each variable" would **NOT** be a sufficient challenge.  This is supposed to be *project* that will require you to do some creative coding, not an easy few lines of code.  Your challenge should also follow from some question about the biology of the system you are investigating.  Hence, you should formulate a question, and your challenge statement should address both the biological elements of the question and the computational challenge involved.
6. **For completion of this assignment (Assignment 10), you will need to do two things**:  
	a. Write a markdown document that contains items #4 and #5 above. Push this document to your Github repository for this class. The markdown document should contain all the information requested above.  It should also contain the full citations of the original publication and the data archive.  The full citation should contain working hyperlinks.  
	b. Create a 5-minute PowerPoint presentation that you will deliver to the class on Tuesday, 4/18.  For ease of presentation smoothness, your presentation MUST be emailed to Sam by 11:59 p.m. on Monday, 4/17.
	
### DUE DATE: Monday, 4/17, 11:59 p.m.



#### Questions? Difficulties?
Start early!  Email Sam if you run into trouble.  Aim to have your data set picked out by this Friday!

#### Note about grading:
The [syllabus](https://github.com/flaxmans/CompBio_on_git/blob/master/CourseDocuments/Syllabus.md#grading-policies) notes that 
>... An independent project will ... constitute 15% of your overall grade. The project will be built from a series of assignments during the semester.    

This Assignment is part of that 15% (contrary to what the initial draft of the syllabus said about this counting toward the Homework grades).
