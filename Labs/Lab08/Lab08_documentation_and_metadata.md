# Lab 08: Documentation and Metadata

###Goals for this lab:
* practice creating metadata files for your work
* practice using Markdown

###Exercises:
1. Complete the Markdown tutorial available at [http://www.markdowntutorial.com/](http://www.markdowntutorial.com/).  
2. Re-write the README for your class repo in markdown.  If you don't have a markdown editor installed, I suggest you try [https://stackedit.io/editor](https://stackedit.io/editor).  Your new README file should have at least one heading, and some good descriptive text about the contents of the repo.  Note that your new README file should be in the top level directory of your repo (do NOT put it in a "Lab08" sub-directory, for example).   
3. Recall [problem #2 from last week's lab](https://github.com/flaxmans/CompBio_on_git/blob/master/Labs/Lab07/Lab07_UserDefinedFunctions.md#problem-2): it asked you to write a function that could implement the discrete-time logistic growth model that did various things.
	1. Create a script in a directory for Lab08 that contains this function (it is fine to copy and paste from your own last week's work)
	2. The script should also call the function so that a figure is produced.
	3. The script should write a data set to a file.  The data file should have two columns: the first column should be "generations", and the second column should be "abundance".
	4. The axes of the figure should be properly labeled.
	5. Make a new markdown document explaining the script.  This markdown document should also be in the directory for Lab08.  This markdown document will be the metadata file that explains the script, the model it contains, what it does, and the specific data that were written to the data file.  Use headings, bulleted lists, and other capabilities of markdown as you see fit.  Make the document look good, easily readable, and functional.
	6. BONUS 1: include a hyperlink in your markdown document that points to the source file for Lab
	7. BONUS 2: save a plot from your model as an image.  Find a way to include that image in the rendered appearance of your metadata document.  The image should be contextualized as example output of your model.
	8. BONUS 3: attempt meta-scripting for creating a file called "parameters.R" for your data set.


### Completing the exercises above:
Completing the above exercises and pushing your work to Github constitutes Assignment 08.  Please complete this by next Friday (i.e., before Lab 09).
