**STUDENTS:** Contents of this repository will change often during the semester.  Please check  back at least weekly ("pull" updates).

This repo will house information for the course on Computational Biology led by Prof. Sam Flaxman at the University of Colorado Boulder.

You can expect to find course documents, helpful hints, assignments, lab problems, and example code here.

Accessibility:  I am committed to making materials as accessible as possible for all students of the class, including those who use any assistive technologies.  Please let me know if there is anything I can do to make these materials more accessible.

Some guidance about what you will find here:

* For the *SYLLABUS*, look in "Course Documents" or just click [here](https://github.com/flaxmans/CompBio_on_git/blob/master/CourseDocuments/Syllabus.md)
* For some of the assigned *READINGS*, you will have to visit the course's Canvas site (because of copyright protections on some readings)
* For *POWERPOINT LECTURE SLIDES*, please visit [this Dropbox folder](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/dd7mpvmbdgyenoo/AAAgi560clFs7_H_XG69by60a?dl=0)
