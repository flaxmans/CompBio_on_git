# Descriptive Characteristics of Colorado Counties

All data here were copied and pasted from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counties_in_Colorado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_counties_in_Colorado), accessed on April 23rd, 2021.

The data came from the table named "The 64 Counties of the State of Colorado".  They were copied then pasted into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, which was then "Saved as..." into two formats on my Mac OS machine: .csv and tab-delimited .txt
